Just a dumb four function calculator that I made in like 30 minutes, well five if you count the exit ability.

To run this, you have two options,

You can download the .exe in the releases ( I promise it's safe! )

and run the .exe, or build it yourself

to build it yourself, you need dotnet, either by installing Visual Studio, or installing it on your os, by doing a quick google search of "How to install dotnet on <enter your os here>" (don't include the <>)

once it's installed, go to the folder this repo is located, open the terminal and type

dotnet restore

dotnet build

dotnet run

in that order


Have fun, I guess.
